- Refine the logging: log message, log visualization progress, checkpoint... all to the same folder? should I??? (because the saving checkpoint can be quite different)
- target for learning rate scheduler must depend on the scheduler type
- Add early stopping
- multi-threading for train and val, separate train and val to different functions
- Automate visual testing
- Add spatial info to the head
- kinetic dataset
- Vision Transformer
- Active learning, analyse scaling laws
- Multi-loss
- verify if SSL good for generalization
- Add type checking
- CI/CD
- Document code with sphinx
- Intervene on the training process, such as modifying the learning rate, or change early stopping criteria
- Study model scaling conventions
