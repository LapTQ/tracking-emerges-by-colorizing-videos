- kinetic dataset

- finetune and verify if SSL good for generalization

- accelerate training (such as multi-threading for train and val?)

- Vision Transformer

- Active learning (part of data-centric?), analyse scaling laws, study model scaling conventions
- Multi-loss
- Use generative learning to compare with reduced loss

- CI/CD (need Automate visual testing?)
- Add type checking
- Document code with sphinx
