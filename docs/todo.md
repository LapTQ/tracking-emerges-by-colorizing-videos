- target for learning rate scheduler must depend on the scheduler type
- Refine the logging: log message, log visualization progress, checkpoint... all to the same folder? should I??? (because the saving checkpoint can be quite different)

- Add spatial info to the head
- kinetic dataset

- multi-threading for train and val, separate train and val to different functions

- verify if SSL good for generalization

- Vision Transformer

- Active learning (part of data-centric?), analyse scaling laws, study model scaling conventions
- Multi-loss
- Use generative learning to compare with reduced loss

- CI/CD (need Automate visual testing?)
- Add type checking
- Document code with sphinx
